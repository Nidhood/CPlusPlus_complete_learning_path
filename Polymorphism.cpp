#include <iostream>


// As another typically concept on the world of POO programing lenaguage, that means literally
// "many forms", this certantly means that different types have the same "interface" (they the same
// behaviur).

// An example of polymorphism it is STL containers, like vector, that have vector<int> and vector<string>.
// An object of a type can be replaced by an object of its subtype (which is called as the 
// Liskov substition principe).
